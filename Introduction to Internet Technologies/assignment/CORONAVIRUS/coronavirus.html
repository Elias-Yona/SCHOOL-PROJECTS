                        <h4 class="subheading">Can coronaviruses be transmitted from person to person?</h4>
                        <p>Yes experts believe the virus that causes corona spreads mainly from person to person through:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Droplets or aerosols.</li>
                            <p>When an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, droplets or tiny particles called aerosols carry the virus into the air from their nose or mouth. Anyone who is within 6 feet of that person can breath it into their lungs.</p> 
                            <li>Airborne transmission.</li>
                            <p>Research shows that the virus can live in the air for up to 3 hours. It can get into your lungs if someone who has it breathes out and you breathe that air in. Experts are divided on how often the virus spreads through the airborne route.</p> 
                            <li>Surface transmission.</li>
                            <p>Another way to catch the new coronavirus is when you touch surfaces that someone who has the virus has coughed or sneezed on. You may touch a countertop or doorknob that's contaminated and then touch your nose, mouth or eyes. The virus can live onsurfaces like plastic and stainless steel for 2 to 3 days. To stop it, clean and disinfect all counters, knobs, and other surfaces you and your family touch several times a day</p>
                            <li>Fecal-oral.</li>
                            <p>Studies also suggest that virus particles can be found in infected people's poop. But experts aren't sure whether the infection can spread through contact with an infected person's stool. If that person uses the bathroom and doesn't wash their hands, they could infect things and people that they touch</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Practice good hand hygiene.</li>
                            <p>To keep your hands clean, wash them thoroughly using soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren’t available, an alcohol-based sanitizer can be used instead. The CDC recommends using a sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol.</p>
                            <li>Avoid coughing or sneezing into your hand.</li>
                            <p>Try to cough or sneeze into a tissue. If a tissue isn’t available, try to cover your cough or sneeze using your elbow/upper arm.</p>
                            <li>Stay home if you are sick.</li>
                            <p>If you’re not feeling well, stay home and let yourself recover. If you have to go out in public, try to wear a face mask to avoid infecting others.</p>
                            <li>Consider alternatives to shaking hands.</li>
                            <p>If you do end up in a situation where you’re shaking hands with a number of people, it’s always a good idea to wash your hands afterwards.</p>
                            <li>Try to avoid touching your face.</li>
                            <p>If droplets containing the virus made their way onto your hands, touching your eyes, nose, or mouth would be the primary way to transfer those droplets into your own body.</p>
